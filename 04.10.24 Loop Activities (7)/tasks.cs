            1. Display the ASCII characters associated with integers from 32 to 126 inclusive.  Do not try to display those less than 32. (Why?)
            (Hint: use the chr function to convert an integer into its corresponding ASCII value.)

            2. If you have not already done so, add loops to the Card Game program (the Extra tasks at the top of page 20).

            3. In compound interest calculations, the amount in an account at the start of the year is multiplied by 1 + R/100, where R% is the interest rate, to give the amount at the end of the year.  Display the amount in the account at the end of each year when an amount (input) is invested for N (input) years at R% (input) per annum.

            4. Write a loop that finds the first power of two that is equal to, or greater than, a number entered by the program user. Be sure that it will work correctly if the user enters zero.

            5. Imagine you have a can of whipped cream. Every second the nozzle stays open, 2% of the remaining cream squirts out. How long, to the nearest second, will it take to empty half the can?

            6. Write a loop that generates random numbers in the range 1 to 100 until ten numbers are generated in the range 1 to 10 and ten are in the range 91 to 100. How many numbers were generated in all?

            7. One plus two is three. One plus two plus three is six. One plus two plus three plus four is ten. If we keep this up long enough, we'll find that the sum of the numbers 1 to n is a perfect square. Find the first three numbers for which this is true.
